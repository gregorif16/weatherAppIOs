    <h1>SuperWeatherApp</h1>
    <p>SuperWeatherApp is a simple iOS application built using Swift and SwiftUI, which provides weather information using the OpenWeather API. The app fetches current weather data for a user-specified location and persists the last searched location using UserDefaults to ensure the location is retrieved on subsequent app launches.</p>
